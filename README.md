# augmented-angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The project is based on [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). 

As to adapt it to my typical workflow, it was augmented with Grunt, Bootstrap, Compass, AngularUI-Bootstrap and AngularUI-router.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone augmented-angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/gwythen/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

Angular-seed comes with a preconfigured `npm` that automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

### Run the Application

Angular-seed comes with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```


### Run Grunt

In order to compile the sass files, you need to run the Grunt build process. In order to do so, simply type:

```
grunt
```

### Grunt Watch

We have preconfigured Grunt to watch sass, javascript and html files and trigger a live reload. In order to activate it,
just type

```
grunt watch
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
